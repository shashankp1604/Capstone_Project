Capstone Project on "Sentimental Analysis on Drug Reviews" using NLP

As we know that Sentiment Analysis is playing a major role in Medical Domain.
It has been shown that performing sentiment analysis on drug reviews is useful in many ways  like when a new drug is released or used users or patients publish their opinions about the drug on the social Web.
The sentiment analysis results of drug reviews will be useful not only for patients to decide which drugs they should buy or take, but also for drug makers and clinicians to obtain valuable summaries of public opinion and feedback.
